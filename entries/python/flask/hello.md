## Introduction
Python is a powerful programming language that is widely used in the development of web applications. One of the popular Python frameworks for building web applications is Flask. Flask is a micro web framework that is easy to use and provides a lot of functionality with very little code.

## Goal
In this tutorial, you will learn step by step how to create a simple web application using Python and Flask.

## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system: 

1. Python (version 3 or above)
2. Flask (you can install it using pip install flask)

## Set up the project directory
First, create a directory for your project and navigate to it. Inside the project directory, create a file called `app.py`. This will be the main file of your web application.

## Import the Flask module
In the `app.py` file, import the Flask module. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of the file:

````python
from flask import Flask
````

## Create an instance of the Flask class
After importing the Flask module, create an instance of the Flask class. You can do this by calling the Flask constructor and passing in the name of the current module as an argument.

````python
app = Flask(__name__)
````

## Define a route
A route is a URL path that your application listens to. When a user visits a route, your application will execute the code associated with that route.

To define a route, you can use the `@app.route` decorator. For example, to define a route that displays a greeting message, you can use the following code:

````python
@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
````

In this example, the '/' route will display the greeting message "Hello, World!" when a user visits it.

## Run the application
Now that you have defined a route, you can run the application by calling the run method of the Flask class. You can do this by adding the following code at the bottom of the app.py file:

````python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
````

To start the web server, open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

````python
python app.py
````

This will start the web server, and you should see the following message:

````commandline
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
````

Now, open a web browser and visit http://localhost:5000/. You should see the greeting message that you defined in the route.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to create a simple web application using Python and Flask. You defined a route and created a simple function that displays a greeting message. You can now build on this foundation and add more functionality to your application.
