## Introduction:
Design patterns play a crucial role in creating flexible, maintainable, and reusable code.
In this blog post, we will delve into the concept of the Template Method pattern and explore how it can be effectively implemented using Java.

## The Template Method Pattern
The Template Method pattern falls under the behavioral design patterns category. It aims to define the outline of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to override specific steps as per their requirements. 
The core idea behind this pattern is to provide a common template or structure for a series of related algorithms.

## Template Method Pattern in Java
Consider a financial institution that processes transactions for various types of accounts, such as savings, checking, and investment accounts. Each account has a different set of rules and requirements for processing a transaction, but the overall transaction processing flow remains the same.

### The class diagram
Basically, the pattern requires and abstract class and at least two concrete classes, in this example we have three different accounts, hence three flows sharing the same algorithm structure but with specific logic.

### The Abstract Class
To implement this scenario using the Template Method pattern, we can create an abstract class `Account` with a **processTransaction()** method that defines the overall flow of processing a transaction. 
The **processTransaction()** method will call several abstract methods, such as **validateTransaction()**, **applyFees()**, and **updateBalance()**, they will be implemented by the concrete subclasses.

```java
public abstract class Account {
    public final void processTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
        validateTransaction(transaction);
        applyFees(transaction);
        updateBalance(transaction);
    }

    protected abstract void validateTransaction(Transaction transaction);

    protected abstract void applyFees(Transaction transaction);

    protected abstract void updateBalance(Transaction transaction);
}
```

### The concrete subclasses
Now, let's create concrete subclasses `SavingsAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, and `InvestmentAccount` that extend the abstract class `Account` and provide their specific implementations for the abstract methods.

```java
public class SavingsAccount extends Account {
    @Override
    protected void validateTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
        // Validate savings account specific rules
    }

    @Override
    protected void applyFees(Transaction transaction) {
        // Apply savings account specific fees
    }

    @Override
    protected void updateBalance(Transaction transaction) {
        // Update savings account balance
    }
}

public class CheckingAccount extends Account {
    @Override
    protected void validateTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
        // Validate checking account specific rules
    }

    @Override
    protected void applyFees(Transaction transaction) {
        // Apply checking account specific fees
    }

    @Override
    protected void updateBalance(Transaction transaction) {
        // Update checking account balance
    }
}

public class InvestmentAccount extends Account {
    @Override
    protected void validateTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
        // Validate investment account specific rules
    }

    @Override
    protected void applyFees(Transaction transaction) {
        // Apply investment account specific fees
    }

    @Override
    protected void updateBalance(Transaction transaction) {
        // Update investment account balance
    }
}
```
Using this approach, we can provide a consistent and reusable structure for processing transactions while allowing each account type to define its specific rules and requirements.

## Advantages of using Template Method Pattern
The Template Method pattern offers several benefits, including:

1. Code Reusability: The template method encapsulates the common parts of an algorithm in a single place, allowing subclasses to reuse the code structure while customizing specific steps. 
2. Flexibility and Extensibility: Subclasses have the freedom to override specific steps, providing the flexibility to modify or extend the behavior of the algorithm without changing its overall structure. 
3. Maintenance and Consistency: By centralizing the algorithm's structure in the base class, changes and updates can be made in one place, ensuring consistency throughout the codebase.

## Downsides of the Template Method Pattern
There also drawback that we need to be aware of: 

1. Fixed Algorithm Structure: The Template Method pattern provides a fixed structure for the algorithm, which may limit the flexibility to modify or extend the algorithm's overall flow. If there is a need for significant variations in the algorithm structure, using the Template Method pattern might not be the best choice. 
2. Class Hierarchy Complexity: Implementing the Template Method pattern often involves creating an abstract base class and concrete subclasses. This can lead to a complex class hierarchy, especially if there are multiple levels of inheritance. It may become challenging to understand and maintain the relationships between the classes. 
3. Dependency Inversion Principle: The Template Method pattern can potentially violate the Dependency Inversion Principle, which states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. In this pattern, the base class defines the overall algorithm structure, and the concrete subclasses depend on it. 

## Conclusions
The Template Method pattern is a powerful tool for designing flexible and maintainable code. But it's essential to evaluate the specific requirements of your project and consider these factors before deciding to use the Template Method pattern. In some cases, other design patterns or alternative approaches may be more suitable to achieve the desired flexibility and maintainability.

Happy code!
