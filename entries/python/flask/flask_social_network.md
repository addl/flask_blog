## What is OAuth?
OAuth is a standardized authorization protocol that provides a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to their server resources on their behalf. OAuth makes sure that all parties involved are protected. OAuth is oftentimes used for authorizing third-party login to websites and apps. OAuth is an open standardized, meaning itâ€™s freely available to use and modify. It was built to be a simple solution to the complicated problem of authorization. 
The OAuth 2.0 framework was designed to address the issues of the previous version and provide users with a safe and secure authorization mechanism.
